# Weather-Journal App Project

In this project, I have  used Node and express to craete both client and server side. "async" functions have been used to "fetch" data (current temperature) from the external server , "post" it to the local server and "get" it back by taking a "zipcode" from the user , an "api key" and a special "url" both from the website we fetching the data from then present it to the user along with how he is currently feeling and the date.

I have created  new HTML and CSS files to apply a new desing and some animations.
