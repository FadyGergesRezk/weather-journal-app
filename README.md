## Key Features:

- Fetch current weather data based on user ZIP code input 📥
- Send and retrieve user feelings/date logs from local server database 💾
- Display updated UI with weather and log details 🖥
- Uses async/await for cleaner asynchronous code 🧠
- Built with Node, Express, and vanilla JavaScript - no front-end frameworks needed 💪
